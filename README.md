This repository provides a **DFT-generated CIF structure** of **Ti₃C₂Se₂**, a selenium-terminated
Ti₃C₂ MXene, intended for computational materials science applications.

## Overview
Ti₃C₂Se₂ is a two-dimensional MXene derived from Ti₃C₂ by selenium surface termination.
This theoretical structure is proposed for first-principles investigations of electronic,
interfacial, and charge-transport properties. Selenium termination is expected to significantly
modify the electronic structure, work function, and surface chemistry compared to more common
oxygen- or fluorine-terminated MXenes.

## Structure Details
- Material: Ti₃C₂Se₂ MXene
- Structure type: Two-dimensional layered MXene
- Surface termination: Selenium (Se)
- Data format: CIF
- Origin: Density Functional Theory (DFT) model
- Crystal symmetry: P1 (slab geometry with vacuum along the c-direction)

## Visualization
The image above shows a representative slab model of the Ti₃C₂Se₂ MXene with selenium atoms
terminating both surfaces. A sufficient vacuum region is included to avoid interactions between
periodic images. Visualization can be reproduced using tools such as **VESTA**, **XCrySDen**,
or **OVITO**.

## Intended Use
This structure is suitable for:
- Quantum ESPRESSO
- VASP
- CASTEP
- Electronic structure calculations
- Surface and interface modeling
- Perovskite-related computational studies
- Work-function and charge-transfer analysis

## Notes
- This structure is a **theoretical model**
- It is **not derived from experimental diffraction data**
- Users are encouraged to fully relax the structure prior to production calculations
- Alternative termination sites (fcc, hcp) and surface coverages may be explored
